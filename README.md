  36.2% of the vine reviews were 5 stars, and 47% of the non-vine reviews were 5 stars.
  
 ## Summary
   The tables show that Vine members did not show bias because they have a lower percentage rating that non-vine members, proving that vine members can be critical when they review. An additional analysis that can be performed is to look into datasets from different categories all together, instead of just one, and compare them to see if there is a bias.
